								<h1>Terms of Use</h1>

								<p>Last Updated Date: February 10, 2015</p>

								<p>GoPro, Inc. d/b/a GoPro ("GoPro") provides its services through our websites accessible at gopro.com, www.goprocamera.com and any other website for which GoPro owns the domain registration (the "Site"), its proprietary video viewing platform and the services made available by GoPro therein, including the "GoPro Network," and certain mobile applications or game system platforms that allow you to access the GoPro services (collectively, the "Service"). These detailed Terms of Use, INCLUDING THE BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION CONTAINED IN SECTION 22, and which incorporate our <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>, <a href="/copyright-policy">Copyright Policy</a>, and <a href="/trademarks">Trademark Policy</a> (collectively "TOU"), govern your use of the Service. It is therefore important that you read and understand these TOU.</p>

								<h2>1. Acceptance of the TOU</h2>

								<p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE OR BY UPLOADING OR POSTING ANY CONTENT (AS DEFINED BELOW) ON THE SERVICE, YOU, YOUR HEIRS, AND ASSIGNS (COLLECTIVELY, "YOU") ARE INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TOU, WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE REGISTERED ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TOU, THEN YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE OR CONTENT. If you accept or agree to these TOU on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these TOU and, in such event, "you" and "your" will refer and apply to that company or other legal entity.</p>

								<p>Certain areas of the Service, including, but not limited to, the areas of the Service through which you may purchase GoPro products, may have different terms and conditions posted or may require you to agree with and accept additional terms and conditions ("Product-Specific Terms"). If there is a conflict between these TOU and terms and conditions posted for a specific area of the Service, the Product-Specific Terms will take precedence with respect to your use of or access to that area of the Service.</p>

								<h2>2. Eligibility</h2>

								<p>The Service is intended solely for persons who are 13 or older. Any access to or use of the Service by anyone under 13 is expressly prohibited. By accessing or using the Service you represent and warrant that you are 13 or older.</p>

								<h2>3. Account Registration</h2>

								<p>In order to access or use certain features of the Service you may be required to create an account ("Account") and become a "Registered User" of the Service. During the registration process you will be required to provide certain information and establish a username and a password. You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and at other times when you use the Service and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. GoPro reserves the right in its sole discretion to refuse to keep Accounts for, or provide services to, any individual. GoPro reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Account if any information provided during the registration process or at other times proves to be inaccurate, not current or incomplete. You are responsible for safeguarding your password. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party and to take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify GoPro of any unauthorized use of your Account.</p>

								<h2>4. Privacy</h2>

Except as expressly provided in these TOU, GoPro and its licensors exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to the Service and Content, including all associated intellectual property rights. You will not remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Service or Content.</p>

								<p>All trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names and any other proprietary designations of GoPro used herein are trademarks or registered trademarks of GoPro. Any other trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names and any other proprietary designations are the trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective parties.</p>

								<h2>6. Your License to Use the Services</h2>

								<p>"Content" on the Service means any links, text, graphics, images, music, audio, video, photos, information, code, or other materials available on the Service. Subject to your compliance with these TOU, GoPro grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the right to sublicense, to access and use the Service, and to access, use, view and print any Content solely for your personal and non-commercial purposes. You will not use, copy, adapt, modify, prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast or otherwise exploit the Service or Content, except as expressly permitted in these TOU.

								<h2>7. User Submitted Content</h2>

								<p>We may, in our sole discretion, permit you to submit, post, upload, publish, email, send or transmit Content on or through the Service or in response to or in connection with Content previously provided via the Service. We may occasionally ask you to resubmit Content to us in a different form. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, GoPro does not claim any ownership rights in your Content and nothing in these TOU will be deemed to restrict any rights that you may have to use and exploit your Content. By making available any Content through the Service, you hereby grant to GoPro a worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, adapt, modify, distribute, reference, store, cache, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast and otherwise exploit such Content on and through third-party distribution channels selected by, but not affiliated with, GoPro, in any form, medium or technology now known or later developed, in whole or in part, for any purposes, including for both commercial and non-commercial purposes, subject to any limitations on use of your private Content, if applicable, in the&nbsp;<a href="/privacy-policy">GoPro Privacy Policy</a>; you also grant GoPro the right to sublicense these rights to third parties for distribution via third party distribution channels, which may include viral distribution of your Content. You agree that neither GoPro nor any third party distribution channels have any obligation to provide any compensation to you for your Content or the licenses granted herein. You understand that GoPro does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to Content you submit. You also hereby grant each user of the Service a non-exclusive license to access your Content through the Service, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform such Content as permitted through the functionality of the Service and under these TOU.</p>

								<p>Notwithstanding the above, if you submit Content to GoPro for GoPro, in its sole discretion, to consider using for its own purposes, you may be asked to agree to a separate license agreement that will supersede this provision with respect to such Content. You acknowledge and agree that GoPro has no obligation to use any Content that you submit and that you have no obligation to agree to license terms other than those presented in this TOU.</p>

								<p>You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for all Content that you make available through the Service. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that: (i) you either are the sole and exclusive owner of all Content that you make available through the Service or you have all rights, licenses, permissions, consents and releases that are necessary to grant to GoPro the rights in such Content, as contemplated under these TOU; and (ii) neither the Content nor your posting, uploading, publication, submission or transmittal of the Content or GoPro’s use of the Content (or any portion thereof) on, through or by means of the Service or otherwise will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party’s patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, moral rights or other proprietary or intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.</p>

								<h2>8. Idea or Proposal Submissions/Feedback</h2>

								<p>For any proposals or ideas that you submit to GoPro, in addition to any other representations or warranties in these TOU, you represent and warrant that you have the right to disclose such ideas or proposal to GoPro and that such disclosure does not violate the rights of any other person or party. You will indemnify and hold harmless and defend GoPro from and against any claims, losses, expenses and liabilities arising from breach by you of the foregoing representation and warranty.</p>

								<p>By submitting your idea or proposal you acknowledge and recognize that GoPro has a number of well-established product lines and is continually busy working on new products, services and technologies, and as such, GoPro may currently or in the future be internally developing proposals, ideas or information or receiving proposals, ideas or information from others that are likely to be similar to the proposals or ideas provided by you. Accordingly, nothing in this TOU shall be construed as a representation or inference that GoPro will not independently develop or authorize the development of products, services or ideas, for itself or for others, that may compete with or be similar to the proposals or ideas you submit. Moreover, GoPro assumes no fiduciary or confidential obligation of any kind with respect to any proposals, ideas or suggestions made by you that relate to GoPro product lines or services. You understand we cannot and do not agree to treat as confidential your ideas, proposals, products, improvements or any other information you may decide to submit or disclose to us, even if the documents are marked as confidential or you indicate the confidential nature of the information, except to the extent covered by a separate written nondisclosure agreement, if any, we may choose to enter into with you. You also understand and agree that GoPro’s willingness to review any proposals or ideas is not an admission by GoPro of novelty, priority, or originality and does not impair GoPro’s right to contest existing or future patents or copyrights claiming the ideas. You agree that GoPro assumes no liability in reviewing these proposals or ideas and agree to rely solely upon such protection as may be afforded under the Patent and Copyright Statutes of the United States of America.</p>

								<p>If you choose to provide feedback, comments and suggestions for improvements to the Service or otherwise (in written or oral form) ("Feedback"), you acknowledge and agree that all Feedback will be the sole and exclusive property of GoPro and you hereby irrevocably assign to GoPro and agree to irrevocably assign to GoPro all of your right, title, and interest in and to all Feedback, including any intellectual property rights therein.</p>

								<h2>15. Disclaimers</h2>

								<p>THE SERVICE AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, GOPRO EXPLICITLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. GOPRO MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICE OR CONTENT WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR BE AVAILABLE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE BASIS. GOPRO MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT GOPRO WILL CONTINUE TO OFFER OR MAKE AVAILABLE THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY PARTICULAR SOFTWARE FOR ANY PARTICULAR LENGTH OF TIME AND GOPRO RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CHANGE AND UPDATE THE SERVICE AND ANY SOFTWARE  WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU. GOPRO MAKES NO WARRANTY REGARDING THE QUALITY OF ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR CONTENT PURCHASED OR OBTAINED THROUGH THE SERVICE OR THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, TRUTHFULNESS, COMPLETENESS OR RELIABILITY OF ANY CONTENT OBTAINED THROUGH THE SERVICE.</p>

								<p>NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED FROM GOPRO OR THROUGH THE SERVICE OR CONTENT, WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN.

								<h2>16. Indemnity</h2>

								<p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold GoPro, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with your access to or use of the Service or Content, or your violation of these TOU.</p>

								<h2>17. Limitation and Liability</h2>

								<p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE AND CONTENT REMAINS WITH YOU. NEITHER GOPRO NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICE OR CONTENT WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT GOPRO HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>

								<p>IN NO EVENT WILL GOPRO’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TOU OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE OR CONTENT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN GOPRO AND YOU. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

								<h2>18. Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</h2>

								<p>These TOU and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any action to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.</p>

								<h2>19. Entire Agreement</h2>

								<p>These TOU constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between GoPro and you regarding the Service and Content, and these TOU supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between GoPro and you regarding the Service and Content.</p>

								<h2>20. Assignment</h2>

								<p>You may not assign or transfer these TOU, by operation of law or otherwise, without GoPro’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these TOU, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. GoPro may assign or transfer these TOU, at its sole discretion, without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these TOU will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>

								<h2>21. Notices</h2>

								<p>Any notices or other communications permitted or required hereunder, including those regarding modifications to these TOU, will be in writing and given by GoPro (i) via email (in each case to the address that you provide) or (ii) by posting to the Service. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p>

								<h2>22. Dispute Resolution</h2>

								<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS.</p>

								<p>You and GoPro agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these TOU or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Site or Service (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and GoPro are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and GoPro otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of these TOU.</p>

								<p><strong>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law</strong>.  The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section.  (The AAA Rules are available at <a href="//www.adr.org/arb_med">www.adr.org/arb_med</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.)  The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</p>

								<p><strong>Arbitration Process</strong>.  A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.  (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at <a href="https://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015820">https://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015820</a> and a separate form for California residents at <a href="https://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822">https://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822</a>.)  The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.  If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>

								<p><strong>Arbitration Location and Procedure</strong>.  Unless you and GoPro otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.  If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and GoPro submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.  If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.  Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>

								<p><strong>Arbitrator’s Decision</strong>.  The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.  The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.  Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  The arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim.  If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.  GoPro will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>

								<p><strong>Fees</strong>.  Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.  However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, GoPro will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>

								<p><strong>Changes</strong>.  Notwithstanding the provisions of the "Modification" section above, if GoPro changes this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first accepted these TOU (or accepted any subsequent changes to these TOU), you may reject any such change at <a href="//gopro.com/support">GoPro Support</a> within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Last Updated Date" above or in the date of GoPro’s email to you notifying you of such change.  By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and GoPro in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution" section as of the date you first accepted these TOU (or accepted any subsequent changes to these TOU).</p>

								<h2>23. General</h2>

								<p>The failure of GoPro to enforce any right or provision of these TOU will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of GoPro. Except as expressly set forth in these TOU, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these TOU will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these TOU or otherwise. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these TOU invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these TOU will remain in full force and effect.</p>
